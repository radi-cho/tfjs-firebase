# Bag of words text classification

This workshop covers:
- Training a model with Tensorflow.js inside Cloud Functions using data from Firestore (JavaScript only).
- Retraining a model; Saving and loading a model.
- Making predictions with a cloud function.

The developed model can predict if a comment is positive or negative. We train it with data from the Firestore database.
The code can be easily modified to predict star reviews, app statistics, etc.
